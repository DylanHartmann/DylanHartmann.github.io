July 17, 1981... was a dreadful day. Our top entity escaped from the compound and is still on the lookout to this day... Entity-703-000, also known as Shorse. We don't know how it has escaped our units, but something from the outside had to let if free, right?

[July 17, 1983 14:30 CODE-001] "This is M.Dos, I might have foun..."
[July 17, 1983 14:45 CODE-002] "M.Dos, are you ok?"
[July 17, 1983 14:50 CODE-002] "M.Dos, are you there?"
[July 17, 1983 15:00 CODE-002] "..."

We have tried our best to find Entity-703-000 but it seems to have the ability to hid itself pretty well, knowing that its size is quite easy to find. Entity-703-001 is its sheep side and Entity-703-002 is its horse side; if I recall correctly.

[July 21, 1983 08:12 CODE-000] We have founded the remains of the shorse, it has seem to have the capabilities to breed.

NOTES: 
1. A shorse is a sheep and a horse combined
2. It doesn't like citrus
3. It waddles back and forth
4. It escaped Area 51
5. It eats from dumpsters
6. When it dies, it explodes
